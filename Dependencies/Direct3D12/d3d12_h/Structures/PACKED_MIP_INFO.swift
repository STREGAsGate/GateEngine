        The number of packed mipmaps in the tiled resource.

        This number starts from the least detailed mipmap (either sharing tiles or using non standard tile layout). This number is 0 if no such packing is in the resource. For array surfaces, this value is the number of mipmaps that are packed for a given array slice where each array slice repeats the same packing.

        On Tier_2 tiled resources hardware, mipmaps that fill at least one standard shaped tile in all dimensions are not allowed to be included in the set of packed mipmaps. On Tier_1 hardware, mipmaps that are an integer multiple of one standard shaped tile in all dimensions are not allowed to be included in the set of packed mipmaps. Mipmaps with at least one dimension less than the standard tile shape may or may not be packed. When a given mipmap needs to be packed, all coarser mipmaps for a given array slice are considered packed as well.

The pixel layout within the packed mipmaps is hardware specific. If apps define only partial mappings for the set of tiles in packed mipmaps, read and write behavior is vendor specific and undefined. For arrays, this value is only the count of packed mipmaps within the subresources for each array slice.

    Your application should transition to this state only for accessing a resource across different graphics engine types.

    Specifically, a resource must be in the COMMON state before being used on a COPY queue (when previous used on DIRECT/COMPUTE), and before being used on DIRECT/COMPUTE (when previously used on COPY). This restriction does not exist when accessing data between DIRECT and COMPUTE queues.

    The COMMON state can be used for all usages on a Copy queue using the implicit state transitions. For more info, in Multi-engine synchronization, find "common".

    Additionally, textures must be in the COMMON state for CPU access to be legal, assuming the texture was created in a CPU-visible heap in the first place.

    /**
    Specifies a heap used for uploading.
    This heap type has CPU access optimized for uploading to the GPU, but does not experience the maximum amount of bandwidth for the GPU.
    This heap type is best for CPU-write-once, GPU-read-once data; but GPU-read-once is stricter than necessary.
    GPU-read-once-or-from-cache is an acceptable use-case for the data; but such usages are hard to judge due to differing GPU cache designs and sizes.
    If in doubt, stick to the GPU-read-once definition or profile the difference on many GPUs between copying the data to a _DEFAULT heap vs. reading the data from an _UPLOAD heap.

    Resources in this heap must be created with D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_GENERIC_READ and cannot be changed away from this.
    The CPU address for such heaps is commonly not efficient for CPU reads.

    The following are typical usages for _UPLOAD heaps:
    * Initializing resources in a _DEFAULT heap with data from the CPU.
    * Uploading dynamic data in a constant buffer that is read, repeatedly, by each vertex or pixel.

    The following are likely not good usages for _UPLOAD heaps:
    * Re-initializing the contents of a resource every frame.
    * Uploading constant data which is only used every other Draw call, where each Draw uses a non-trivial amount of other data.

    The CPU cache behavior is write-back, which is conducive for multiple sub-cache-line CPU reads.

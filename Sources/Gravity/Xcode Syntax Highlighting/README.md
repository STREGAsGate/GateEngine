# Gravity Syntax Highlighting in Xcode

1. Run GravityUTI.app (it will just close instantly)
2. Quit and reopen Xcode

Xcode, and all of macOS, will now recognize gravity files as Swift-like files which will cause Xcode to use Swift syntax highlighting.
The source code for GravityUTI is also available if you prefer to make it yourself.
